# Added new column to calculate difference between methance conc column and total.methane.conc column
# compacted new data frame (methane.new)

kable(head(
  methane.new <-
  methane_data %>%
  mutate(conc.diff = total.methane.conc - methane.conc) %>%
    select(day, rep.no, treatment.control, time, conc.diff)
))

### Data organised by 
```{r}
kable(
  methane.new %>%
    group_by(treatment.control, day, time) %>%
    summarise(mean(conc.diff))
  )
